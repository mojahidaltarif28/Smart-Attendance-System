# AI-Based Smart Attendance System

This project is an artificial intelligence-based smart attendance system created for academic purposes. The system utilizes a camera to automatically record attendance during class sessions. Both the backend and frontend of the project are developed exclusively in Python.

## Overview

The smart attendance system leverages computer vision and AI techniques to recognize and record student attendance in real-time. The system is designed to simplify the process of taking attendance, reducing manual effort and increasing accuracy.

## Features

- **Automatic Attendance Recording**: Uses a camera to detect and record the presence of students in the classroom.
- **Real-Time Face Recognition**: AI-powered face recognition to identify and mark attendance.
- **Python-Based Backend and Frontend**: The entire system, including user interface and data processing, is built using Python.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language used for both backend and frontend development.
- **OpenCV**: Library for computer vision tasks, including face detection and recognition.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Frameworks used for developing and training the AI models.
